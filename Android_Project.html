<div class="center" style="font-size:150%; font-family:Arial; color:white;"><p>Written Response</p></div>
<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><p>When the game loads up a brand screen showing Earth Defense Force and EDF. After the branding screen presents itself, the screen will move to the main menu, on the top of the screen is Play Game! button and on the bottom is an About button. Click on the Play Game! button the game will show up, on the top of the screen are the meteors if the meteors are tapped, the image will change to an explosion image and return to the top of the screen and change back to the meteor image. On the bottom of the screen is an artillery truck that represents the player and the truck moves across the screen as a representation of the actions that the player does. Also at the very bottom of the screen is a Add More Meteors button and a Reset button, both are self-explanatory, but the Add More Meteors button will add more meteors; increasing the difficuly of the game and the Reset button which will restart the game screen. If a meteor does reach the bottom of the screen, the game will move over to a You Lose screen and at the top of the screen there is a button that will take the player back to the main menu. This is the process of how the game works, from loading to player interaction, just make sure you stop the meteors from hitting the Earth.</p></div> 

<div class="center" style="font-size:150%; font-family:Arial; color:white;"><p>Problems in the Process of developing the game</p>

<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><p>While as a whole the project was not far off from the beginning app that the class had work together on. But one difficulty that I faced was when the meteor was tapped it presented an explosion png, the problem was that the explosion was still present even after the meteor was tapped. To solve this problem some unnecessary code was removed and the amount of time that the image would be present was reduced from 3 seconds down to 1 second, with these changes the image changes quicker than before which is what I was hoping for.</p>
<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><p>My second problem while small was still a nuisance, the problem was transferring the game code all on to the game screen and Screen1 is going to be the branding screen, but I needed to add images or change some details. The whole ordeal was tedious and took up most of the class period. While transferring over code from one screen to the other seems easy, small details can be missed and some code cannot work without those details, most of the problems were with the designer view, but with time and careful inspection all of the code that needed to move over was taken care of.</p>
