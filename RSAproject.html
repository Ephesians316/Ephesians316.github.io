<div class="center"><p style="font-family:Arial; color:white;">To start up the program, the user must type in "RSAprogram" in or for it to launch. Once inputed, three options appear, one for encryption, another for decryption, and the last being an option to exit the program. If the user types in "1", the options to input the "e" and "n" will be presented, these lines are representing the public key for the user to encrypt and send to another person with the same public key. After the user inputs "e" and "n" the user may type in a sentence or any length words. Once completed, the user is given the encrypted message and now they may send it to whoever needs it. Adding on, if the user types "2" the option to decrypt a message will be available. The program will ask for the input of a "d" and "n" value, these values represent the private key that only the user using it has access to. After putting in the "d" and "n" values, the program will ask for the encrypted message, the use can then copy and paste their encrypted message and then be bale to find out what the encrpyted message states. Fianlly, there is the option for theuser to simply exit the program, there doesn't have to be that much explain for it.</p></div>

<div class="center"><h1 style="font-family:Arial; color:white;">Problems While Creating the Code</h1></div>
<div class="center"><p style="font-family:Arial; color:white;">The first problem that my partner and I faced was fixing the decryption part of our program, before fixing it, we used a "d" value and a "PhiN" value; the PhiN is is the Greek letter Phi with a "n" value. While in the encryption part, we used an "e" and "n" value, for a while trying to decrypt meesages was difficult because of the fact that my partner and I were using different values for encrption and decryption. Finally, we figured out the problem, for the decrption part of the code, we needed to ask for the "d" and "n" value; not "PhiN", this follows that the "d" and "n" values create a private key, while the "e" and "n" values represent the public key. Another minor problem that plagued the development of the code was transferring our code from the program called "Enthought Canopy" to a web-based program called "repl.it". Adding on the program code was different; in Enthought we used Python 2.7, while in repl.it we had to use Python 3 in order to have better access to the "chr" system in Python 3. Luckly moving the code from a different program to another was simple, but still it was tedious making minor changes.</p></div>
