<div class="center"><p style="font-family:Arial; color:white;">To start up the program, the user must type in "RSAprogram" in or for it to launch. Once inputted, three options appear, one for encryption, another for decryption, and the last being an option to exit the program. If the user types in "1", the options to input the "e" and "n" will be presented, these lines are representing the public key for the user to encrypt and send to another person with the same public key. After the user inputs "e" and "n" the user may type in a sentence or any length words. Once completed, the user is given the encrypted message and now they may send it to whoever needs it. Adding on, if the user types "2" the option to decrypt a message will be available. The program will ask for the input of a "d" and "n" value, these values represent the private key that only the user using it has access to. After putting in the "d" and "n" values, the program will ask for the encrypted message, the user can then copy and paste their encrypted message and then is able to find out what the encrypted message states. Finally, there is the option for the user to simply exit the program, there doesn't have to be that much explanation for it.</p></div>

<div class="center"><h1 style="font-family:Arial; color:white;">Problems While Creating the Code</h1></div>
<div class="center"><p style="font-family:Arial; color:white;">The first problem that my partner and I faced was fixing the decryption part of our program, before fixing it, we used a "d" value and a "PhiN" value; the PhiN is is the Greek letter Phi with an "n" value. While in the encryption part, we used an "e" and "n" value, for a while trying to decrypt messages was difficult because of the fact that my partner and I were using different values for encryption and decryption. Finally, we figured out the problem, for the decryption part of the code, we needed to ask for the "d" and "n" value; not "PhiN", this follows that the "d" and "n" values create a private key, while the "e" and "n" values represent the public key. Another minor problem that plagued the development of the code was transferring our code from the program called "Enthought Canopy" to a web-based program called "repl.it". Adding on the program code was different; in Enthought we used Python 2.7, while in repl.it we had to use Python 3 in order to have better access to the "chr" system in Python 3. Luckily moving the code from a different program to another was simple, but still, it was tedious making minor changes.</p></div>

<div class="center"><p style="font-family:Arial; color:white;">In the video I am launching the code, the main part of my program is called "RSAprogram()" so of course, that is what I will type in to run my code. After launching the program, I type in "1" in order to encrypt a message, next I type in my "E" value and then my "N" value, after doing so I made my message "Hello World!". After entering that message in I receive an encrypted message, later I type in 2 in order to then decrypt the message. I am prompted to type in my "D" and "N" value and I follow suit, next I copy and paste my encrypted message and finally, I receive my decrypted message "Hello World!". Finally, I type 3 multiple times to exit the program, I have yet to fix that problem; so far I am not sure to why it does this, but I hope to fix it later in the future.</p>
