<div class="center"><p style="font-family:Arial; color:white;">When the code is launched, a GUI will pop up showing what day it is, the date, the time, and the year. Adding on, below the time are three buttons, on the left there is a button that is named "Set Alarm" which as the name suggests set an alarm, next on the right is a button named "Off" which will turn off an alarm off if one is active, finally on the very bottom is a snooze button which will temporarily turn off an alarm if an alarm is going off. Next on the list are the drop-down menus on the top left of the GUI, the two drop-down tabs are "Options" and "Info", under the "Options" tab there is "Set Alarm", "Snooze" and "Off", all of these options are the same as the buttons when someone launches the program, it simply gives the user the option to use something different. Under the "Info" tab is "about" and "how to", the "about" option presents who created the code of the program and the "how to" option gives a quick rundown on how to set up an alarm.</p></div>

<div class="center"><h1 style="font-family:Arial; color:white;">Problems While Creating the Code</h1></div>
<div class="center"><p style="font-family:Arial; color:white;">Problems that my partner and I faced while creating the code where one setting up a dynamic clock and two creating a functional "Set Alarm" button. Starting off, researching to find an easy way to code in a clock that not only displays time but will also display time dynamically, where the seconds will change and the minutes will change, and so one, but in the beginning finding any decent and simple to understand code was difficult, after a while we found code that can display time but only the time when the program is first launched. Finally, after some time we finally found code that was both simple and that displayed time dynamically. Next was finding out how to set an alarm, before finding a solution, the two of us just used a JFrame to display the inputs to set up an alarm, unfortunately, the inputs were only taking in strings which can't be used to set up an alarm that requires an integer. Despite that, we, fortunately, found a solution where we have to type cast the inputs that would convert a string into an integer.</p></div>
