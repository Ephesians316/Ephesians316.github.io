<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><h1>Story of "Sling"</h1>
<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><p>It's 1865 in the state of Texas, you are Carson Smith, a part-time bartender getting money to support your farm and your mother. You meet a man by the name of Bill Conagher; a retired Mexican-American veteran, who seeks revenge on the gang leader Cain McDonald. Will you help Conagher in his quest for redemption? Will you fight Cain McDonald and his gang?</p>

<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><h1>Written Response</h1>
<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><p>When you first run the program, there will be a transition that will present the title "SLING: A western story" under the title, there is text that prompts the user to either type "Start" or "Info". Typing "Start" will begin the story, while typing "Info" will guide the user to the info page, with a large title "INFO" and a cowboy both in ASCIII below it. On the very bottom of the page will show the creators, a link to the project's github repository, and a prompt to type "Back" to go back to the title screen. When going through the story, prompts to type a certain command will be presented to the user, such as "type 'walk' or 'ignore' to continue". When your character dies in ASCII text the title "YOU DIED" will show up and the user will have to restart the whole game.</p></div>

<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><h1>Process of the code</h1>
<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><p>In the first part of writing up the code, I took care of writing up the narrative of the story, while also adding on the decisions to the functions that required decisions, while functions that only reveal more narrative I made decisions such as "type 'c' or 'C' to continue". The second part was dedicated to my partner Sam Ramuin, Sam created the "Dice roll" mechanic that is used later in the game where Smith and Conagher are fighting the Copper Falls gang, it took time, as well as trial and error but it worked out in the end.</p>

<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><h1>Problems while coding</h1>
<div class="center" style="font-family:Arial; color:white;"><p>Problems that I faced while coding was mostly dealt with syntax. Making sure syntax was annoying and tedious to work with. At times I could not figure out what the problem was with the syntax, but after a while I realized the mistake and took care of it. Also a problem that I faced was my lack of knowledge with Python, before this project I had no clue how to use python. Working on the project a lot of my code was basic and the code was a bit messy, but now that I have more knowledge I will be able write code and make it look a bit more clean.</p>
